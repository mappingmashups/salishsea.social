I would love it if someone set up a Mastodon instance at salishsea.social for the Salish Sea region (the bodies of water that include Puget Sound, the Strait of Georgia, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the water around the San Juan Islands and Gulf Islands in British Columbia).

I don't have the capacity to set up and run the server myself, but I can help!
