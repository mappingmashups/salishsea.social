# salishsea.social
I would love it if someone set up a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance at _salishsea.social_ for the Salish Sea region (the bodies of water that include Puget Sound, the Strait of Georgia, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the water around the San Juan Islands and Gulf Islands in British Columbia).

**UPDATE**: I helped create a server for Bellingham, Washington (the City of Subdued Excitement) at [subdued.social](https://subdued.social/about)! If you're near Bellingham, come join us there!

I will probably let the registration for _salishsea.social_ lapse in a year if nobody volunteers to pick it up. Personally I think I will be happy at [subdued.social](https://subdued.social/about).
